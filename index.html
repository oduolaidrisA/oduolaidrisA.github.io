      <h2>Home</h2>
      <p>
        I am an applied mathematician with a strong interest in Computational Science and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)
        to enhance traditional methods.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          I received my MSc in Mathematics from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), where I
          solved quantum eigenvalue problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          My research goals are to:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Develop computationally efficient algorithms that scale to high-dimensional problems.</li>
          <li>Design structure-preserving ML methods that respect physical structures (e.g., symmetries, conservation laws, energy dissipation).</li>
          <li>Reduce reliance on ad-hoc hyperparameter tuning by ensuring provable guarantees (e.g., accuracy, convergence, stability) for ML approaches to complex problems.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2> Research Interest:</h2>  
      <ul>
        <li> Scientific Machine Learning, AI for Science;</li>
        <li> Data-driven reduced-order modeling;</li>

        <h2> Miscellaneous</h2>  
      <ul class="education-list">
        <li> [07/2025]: Despite taking several courses, I find it quite disappointing not to have taken any course on conservation laws. Anyways,
          I have been studying the book by Randall LeVeque, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-0348-8629-1" target="_blank">Numerical Methods for Conservation Laws</a>.
            The introduction is really friendly, it gets much more interesting as you move past each chapter,
            and some of the exercises looks simple but challenging. It is a really good book, and I'd advise anyone in my shoe to check it out. 

        </li>
        <li> 
          [07/2025]: I also find Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) fascinating, it is almost ubiquitous, from Aerospace to the Petroleum industries,
          fluids surrounds us and like many others, they are governed by several laws of physics/mathematics. I spent much of my summer 
          studying <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9780898718942" target="_blank">Computational Methods for Multiphase 
            Flows in Porous Media</a> published by SIAM.
          Though, restricted to FEM and Porous media (<em>where conservation of momentum is modeled by Darcy's law</em>), the book is interesting
          because just like in LeVeque, the beginning chapters summarizes the bulk of concepts of fluid flow (in porous media).
        </li>
        <li>
          [07/2025]: Other books which I recently studied (in parts) in my free time and are also interesting are:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-41196-5", target="_blank">Programming Phase-Field Modeling</a>, by Bulent Biner;</li>
            <li><a href="http://brennen.caltech.edu/INTMult/multbook.pdf", target="_blank">Fundamentals of Multiphase Flow</a>, by Christopher Brennen;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I  appreciate book suggestions, and I'm grateful to KFUPM Library for borrowing me most of the books listed above.
        </li>
      </ul>
